# Custom Sakai Scripts

## About
I wrote this collection of scripts to help my institution manage it's course creation and maintenance.

## Dependencies

	gem install Savon

You could probably do this with soap4r but it's been depricated in Ruby 1.9 going forward, and even though it can be installed, Savon is just too easy to use.
